# The Angular Avengers!

##Overview of the Project
jobPress is a public job searching site. It blends the ability to save what you applied for and the accessibility of seeing all the jobs on Google Maps. The idea for this site came from how difficult it can be to keep track of the jobs you apply for. This site gives you the ability too not only find the jobs your looking for easily, but save the ones you want to keep track of.
